This paper conducts a retrospective study to show how performance scores can vary when a dataset expands from a single annotation per instance to multiple annotations. We propose a novel multi-annotator simulation process to generate datasets with varying annotation budgets. We show that similar datasets with the same annotation budget can lead to varying performance gains. Our findings challenge the popular belief that models trained on multi-annotation examples always lead to better performance than models trained on single or few-annotation examples.},

Though we observe several high-quality long-sequence datasets for English and other monolingual languages, there is no significant effort in building such resources for code-mixed languages such as Hinglish (code-mixing of Hindi-English). In this paper, we propose a novel task of identifying multi-sentential code-mixed text (MCT) from multilingual articles. As a use case, we leverage multilingual articles from two different data sources and build a first-of-its-kind multi-sentential code-mixed Hinglish dataset i.e., MUTANT. We propose a token-level language-aware pipeline and extend the existing metrics measuring the degree of code-mixing to a multi-sentential framework and automatically identify MCT in the multilingual articles. The MUTANT dataset comprises 67k articles with 85k identified Hinglish MCTs. To facilitate future research directions, we will make the dataset and the code publicly available upon publication.},

	abstract     = {The impact and significance of a scientific publication is measured mostly by the number of citations it accumulates over the years. Early prediction of the citation profile of research articles is a significant as well as challenging problem. In this paper, we argue that features gathered from the citation contexts of the research papers can be very relevant for citation prediction. Analyzing a massive dataset of nearly 1.5 million computer science articles and more than 26 million citation contexts, we show that average countX (number of times a paper is cited within the same article) and average citeWords (number of words within the citation context) discriminate between various citation ranges as well as citation categories. We use these features in a stratified learning framework for future citation prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing citation prediction models by a margin of 8-10\% on an average under various experimental settings. Specifically, the features derived from the citation context help in predicting long-term citation behavior.},

Extensive evaluations show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art tools by a large margin in structural information extraction along with improved performance in metadata and bibliography extraction tasks, both in terms of accuracy (around 50{\%} improvement) and processing time (around 52{\%} improvement). A user experience study conducted with the help of 30 researchers reveals that the researchers found this system to be very helpful. As an additional objective, we discuss two novel use cases including automatically extracting links to public datasets from the proceedings, which would further accelerate the advancement in digital libraries. The result of the framework can be exported as a whole into structured TEI-encoded documents. Our framework is accessible online at \url{http://www.cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/OCR++/home/}.},

In this paper, we propose ConfAssist, a novel assisting framework for conference categorization that aims to address the limitations in the existing systems and portals for venue classification. We start with the hypothesis that top-tier conferences are much more stable than other conferences and the inherent dynamics of these groups differs to a very large extent. We identify various features related to the stability of conferences that might help us separate a top-tier conference from the rest of the lot. While there are many clear cases where expert agreement can be almost immediately achieved as to whether a conference is a top-tier or not, there are equally many cases that can result in a conflict even among the experts. ConfAssist tries to serve as an aid in such cases by increasing the confidence of the experts in their decision. An analysis of 110 conferences from 22 sub-fields of computer science clearly favors our hypothesis as the top-tier conferences are found to exhibit much less fluctuations in the stability related features than the non-top-tier ones. We evaluate our hypothesis using systems based on conference categorization. For the evaluation, we conducted human judgment survey with 28 domain experts. The results are impressive with 85.18% classification accuracy. We also compare the dynamics of the newly started conferences with the older conferences to identify the initial signals of popularity. The system is applicable to any conference with atleast 5 years of publication history.}

Providing users with an interface which enables the filtering of recommendations across multiple facets can increase users' control over how the recommendation system behaves. FeRoSA is precisely built on a random walk based framework on an induced subnetwork consisting of nodes related to the query paper in terms of either citations or content similarity. Rigorous analysis based an experts' judgment shows that FeRoSA outperforms two baseline systems in terms of faceted recommendations (overall precision of 0.65). Further, we show that the faceted results of FeRoSA can be appropriately combined to design a better flat recommendation system as well. An experimental version of FeRoSA is publicly available at www.ferosa.org(receiving as many as 170 hits within the first 15 days of launch).},

	abstract     = {The rate at which nodes in evolving social networks acquire links (friends, citations) shows complex temporal dynamics. Preferential attachment and link copying models, while enabling elegant analysis, only capture rich-gets-richer effects, not aging and decline. Recent aging models are complex and heavily parameterized; most involve estimating 1-3 parameters per node. These parameters are intrinsic: they explain decline in terms of events in the past of the same node, and do not explain, using the network, where the linking attention might go instead. We argue that traditional characterization of linking dynamics are insufficient to judge the faithfulness of models. We propose a new temporal sketch of an evolving graph, and introduce several new characterizations of a network's temporal dynamics. Then we propose a new family of frugal aging models with no per-node parameters and only two global parameters. Our model is based on a surprising inversion or undoing of triangle completion, where an old node relays a citation to a younger follower in its immediate vicinity. Despite very few parameters, the new family of models shows remarkably better fit with real data. Before concluding, we analyze temporal signatures for various research communities yielding further insights into their comparative dynamics. To facilitate reproducible research, we shall soon make all the codes and the processed dataset available in the public domain.},

The current work poses several interesting questions and attempts to answer them by empirically investigating a large bibliographic text dataset from computer science containing millions of lines of citation sentences. In particular, we report evidences of massive copying behavior. We also present several striking real examples throughout the paper to showcase widespread adoption of this undesirable practice. In contrast to the popular perception, we find that copying tendency increases as an author matures.

In this paper, we discuss a specific case, MSP-2, and shows its efficacy in reconstructing several non-trivial characteristic properties of social networks, including networks with power-law degree distribution, power-law with an exponential decay (exponential cut-off), and exponential degree distributions. We evaluate the proposed evolution mechanism over two real-world networks and observe that the generated networks highly resembles the degree distribution of the real-world networks.

In addition to verifying standard constraints, we also propose distinctive signals gathered from network-centric properties to understand this evolving ecosystem better.

More exciting research nowadays is happening perhaps at the interfaces of disciplines like Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. How do these interfaces emerge and interact? For instance, is there a specific pattern in which these fields cite each other? In this article, we investigate a collection of more than 1.2 million papers from three different scientific disciplines -- Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. We show how over a timescale the citation patterns from the core science fields (Physics, Mathematics) to the applied and fast-growing field of Computer Science have drastically increased. Further, we observe how certain subfields in these disciplines are shrinking while others are becoming tremendously popular. For instance, an intriguing observation is that citations from Mathematics to the subfield of machine learning in Computer Science in recent times are exponentially increasing.},

	abstract     = {A leaderboard is a tabular presentation of performance scores of the best competing techniques that address a specific scientific problem. Manually maintained leaderboards take time to emerge, which induces a latency in performance discovery and meaningful comparison. This can delay dissemination of best practices to non-experts and practitioners. Regarding papers as proxies for techniques, we present a new system to automatically discover and maintain leaderboards in the form of partial orders between papers, based on performance reported therein. In principle, a leaderboard depends on the task, data set, other experimental settings, and the choice of performance metrics. Often there are also tradeoffs between different metrics. Thus, leaderboard discovery is not just a matter of accurately extracting performance numbers and comparing them. In fact, the levels of noise and uncertainty around performance comparisons are so large that reliable traditional extraction is infeasible. We mitigate these challenges by using relatively cleaner, structured parts of the papers, e.g., performance tables. We propose a novel performance improvement graph with papers as nodes, where edges encode noisy performance comparison information extracted from tables. Every individual performance edge is extracted from a table with citations to other papers. These extractions resemble (noisy) outcomes of `matches' in an incomplete tournament. We propose several approaches to rank papers from these noisy `match' outcomes. We show that our ranking scheme can reproduce various manually curated leaderboards very well. Using widely-used lists of state-of-the-art papers in 27 areas of Computer Science, we demonstrate that our system produces very reliable rankings. We also show that commercial scholarly search systems cannot be used for leaderboard discovery, because of their emphasis on citations, which favors classic papers over recent performance breakthroughs. Our code and data sets will be placed in the public domain.},

Network scientists contemplate randomness as one of the most desirable characteristics for real complex systems’ efficient performance. However, the current methodologies for randomness (or nonrandomness) quantification are nontrivial. In this article, we empirically showcase severe limitations associated with the state-of-the-art graph spectral-based quantification approaches. Addressing these limitations led to the proposal of a novel spectrum-based methodology that leverages configuration models as a reference network to quantify the nonrandomness in a given candidate network. Besides, we derive mathematical formulations for demonstrating the dependence of nonrandomness on three structural properties: modularity, clustering, and the highest degree node’s growth rate. We also introduce a novel graph signature (termed “cumulative spectral difference”) to visualize the nonrandomness in the network. Later, this article also discusses the relationship between the proposed nonrandomness measure and the diffusion affinity of networks. Toward the end, this article extensively discusses observations emerging from these signatures for both real-world and simulated networks.},

In the multilingual communities, it is a very frequently observed pattern of communication on social media platforms. Flexibility to use multiple languages in one text message might help to communicate efficiently with the target audience. But, the noisy user-generated code-mixed text adds to the challenge of processing and understanding natural language to a much larger extent. Machine translation from monolingual source to the target language is a well-studied research problem. Here, we demonstrate that widely popular and sophisticated translation systems such as Google Translate fail at times to translate code-mixed text effectively. To address this challenge, we present a parallel corpus of the 13,738 code-mixed Hindi-English sentences and their corresponding human translation in English. In addition, we also propose a translation pipeline build on top of Google Translate. The evaluation of the proposed pipeline on $PHINC$ demonstrates an increase in the performance of the underlying system. With minimal effort, we can extend the dataset and the proposed approach to other code-mixing language pairs.}

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for the extraction of catchphrases from the abstracts of patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office over the years. Our proposed system achieves substantial improvement, both in terms of precision and recall, against state-of-the-art techniques. As a second objective, we conduct an extensive empirical study to understand the temporal evolution of the catchphrases across various organizations. We also show how the overall innovation evolution in the form of introduction of newer catchphrases in an organization's patents correlates with the future citations received by the patents filed by that organization.

	abstract     = {Extensive literature demonstrates how the copying of references (links) can lead to the emergence of various structural properties (e.g., power-law degree distribution and bipartite cores) in bibliographic and other similar directed networks. However, it is also well known that the copying process is incapable of mimicking the number of directed triangles in such networks; neither does it have the power to explain the obsolescence of older papers. In this paper, we propose RefOrCite, a new model that allows for copying of both the references from (i.e., out-neighbors of) as well as the citations to (i.e., in-neighbors of) an existing node. In contrast, the standard copying model (CP) only copies references. While retaining its spirit, RefOrCite differs from the Forest Fire (FF) model in ways that makes RefOrCite amenable to mean-field analysis for degree distribution, triangle count, and densification. Empirically, RefOrCite gives the best overall agreement with observed degree distribution, triangle count, diameter, h-index, and the growth of citations to newer papers.},

In contrast to previous topic modelling based approaches, we manually curate five course-grained non-exclusive topical categories namely Linguistic Target (Syntax, Discourse, etc.), Tasks (Tagging, Summarization, etc.), Approaches (unsupervised, supervised, etc.), Languages (English, Chinese, etc.) and Dataset types (news, clinical notes, etc.). Some of the novel features include a list of young popular authors, popular URLs and datasets, list of topically diverse papers and recent popular papers. Also, it provides temporal statistics such as yearwise popularity of topics, datasets, and seminal papers. To facilitate future research and system development, we make all the processed dataset accessible through API calls. The current system is available at http://nlpexplorer.org.},

Various widely popular metrics perform poorly with the code-mixed NLG tasks. To address this challenge, we present a metric in- dependent evaluation pipeline MIPE that significantly improves the correlation between evaluation metrics and human judgments on the generated code-mixed text. As a use case, we demonstrate the performance of MIPE on the machine-generated Hinglish (code-mixing of Hindi and English languages) sentences from the HinGE corpus. We can extend the proposed evaluation strategy to other code-mixed language pairs, NLG tasks, and evaluation metrics with minimal to no effort.},

While impact assessment and adaptation planning rely on high-resolution projections (typically in the order of a few kilometers), state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) are available at spatial resolutions of few hundreds of kilometers. Current solutions to obtain high-resolution projections of ESMs include downscaling approaches that consider the information at a coarse-scale to make predictions at local scales. Complex and non-linear interdependence among local climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors (e.g., pressure fields) motivate the use of neural network-based super-resolution architectures. In this work, we present auxiliary variables informed spatio-temporal neural architecture for statistical downscaling. The current study performs daily downscaling of precipitation variable from an ESM output at 1.15 degrees (115 km) to 1/4 degrees (25 km) over one of the most climatically diversified countries, India. We showcase significant improvement gain against two popular state-of-the-art baselines with a better ability to predict statistics of extreme events.

However, the idea of delivering instructions to a computer through natural language could vastly simplify the act of programming as a specific task. Generating code from high-level descriptions for a given program is a significantly challenging task and has been an active area of research in the natural language processing domain. In this paper, we present a novel feedback-based deep learning approach for synthesizing code from human-specified descriptions. Inspired by the dual-learning mechanism, our framework uses a feedback loss to produce more consistent and robust predictions. We show how our approach fares empirically on standard code generation datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on the NAPS (Natural Program Synthesis) dataset.},

	abstract     = {Tsunamis, power blackouts, and distribution systems failure drastically affect the networked infrastructure systems which further affect a countries economy. Moreover, if these systems reach critical thresholds, they may experience disproportionate losses in the system’s functionality. Here we propose an approach to identify the critical thresholds and observe the presence of warning regions for real-world transportation systems. While attack tolerance of networked systems has been intensively studied for the disruptions originating from a single point of failure, there have been instances where real-world systems are subject to concurrent disruptions at multiple locations. We determine the entire robustness characteristics of transportation networks of disparate architecture subject to disruptions of varying sizes. Using United States Airspace Airport network and Indian Railways Network data, and synthetic networks as prototype class of systems, we study their responses to synthetic attack strategies of varying sizes. We also observe the significant relationships between network robustness and size of simultaneous disruptions for the complex networked infrastructures for random failures and targeted attacks. Our approach can serve as a paradigm to understand the point of sudden collapse in real-world systems, and the principle can be extended to other network infrastructures to address critical issues of risk management, resilience, and system safety.},

	abstract     = {The impact and significance of a scientific publication is measured mostly by the number of citations it accumulates over the years. Early prediction of the citation profile of research articles is a significant as well as challenging problem. In this paper, we argue that features gathered from the citation contexts of the research papers can be very relevant for citation prediction. Analyzing a massive dataset of nearly 1.5 million computer science articles and more than 26 million citation contexts, we show that average countX (number of times a paper is cited within the same article) and average citeWords (number of words within the citation context) discriminate between various citation ranges as well as citation categories. We use these features in a stratified learning framework for future citation prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing citation prediction models by a margin of 8-10\% on an average under various experimental settings. Specifically, the features derived from the citation context help in predicting long-term citation behavior.},
